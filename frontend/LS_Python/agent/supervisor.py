"""
Shard supervisor — spawn and keep alive N worker processes.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Every userbot holds a persistent WebRTC live-stream connection. When hundreds of
those live in ONE process/event loop, a momentary stall starves the native
keepalives and Telegram evicts many peers at once — the "join then everyone drops
after 2-3 min" bug. The cure is horizontal: run several worker PROCESSES, each on
its own CPU core with its own event loop, and give each one only a SLICE of the
userbots. This module launches and babysits those processes.

HOW SHARDING WORKS
------------------
Each account has a stable integer id. Shard `i` (of `N`) owns an account when
`account_id % N == i`, so every bot lives in exactly one process. Per-account jobs
are routed by that same rule in `db.claim_next_jobs`. Fan-out actions
(view/react/leave-all) are enqueued once and shard 0 expands them into one copy
per shard, so they still reach every bot. All of that logic lives in the worker;
this supervisor only owns process lifecycle.

USAGE
-----
    # spawns LS_WORKER_SHARDS processes (default 10)
    python -m agent.supervisor

Set the shard count in .env:
    LS_WORKER_SHARDS=10
    LS_SOFT_MAX_PER_SHARD=70

Single-process mode is still available with no supervisor:
    python -m agent.worker        # SHARD_COUNT defaults to 1

Keep the supervisor alive on a VPS with screen/tmux/nohup or a systemd service —
exactly like you already do for the worker. If any shard crashes, the supervisor
restarts it automatically (with a short backoff).
